Interestingly, by analysing the probability of survival based on few attributes like gender, age, and social status, we can make very accurate predictions on which passengers would survive. Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. Therefore, we can learn about the society priorities and privileges at the time."],"metadata":{"id":"FfbHTdHcAnRV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import re\n","\n","# to handle datasets\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import joblib\n","\n","# for visualization\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# to divide train and test set\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","# feature scaling\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","\n","# to build the models\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","\n","# to evaluate the models\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score\n","\n","# to persist the model and the scaler\n","import joblib\n","\n","# to visualise al the columns in the dataframe\n","pd.pandas.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n","\n","# pipeline\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","\n","#import preprocessors\n","from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\n","\n","\n","!pip install feature_engine\n","\n","# for imputation\n","from feature_engine.imputation import (\n","    CategoricalImputer,\n","    AddMissingIndicator,\n","    MeanMedianImputer)\n","\n","# for encoding categorical variables\n","from feature_engine.encoding import (\n","    RareLabelEncoder,\n","    OneHotEncoder\n",")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6f4QiMU2Ap-Y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655671667466,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":3288,"user":{"displayName":"ilias dimitrakopoulos","userId":"13270434416198801137"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"b077ae7c-2d5f-4b5a-b6fd-492c9bef0d5f"},"execution_count":53,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Requirement already satisfied: feature_engine in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (1.4.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy>=1.4.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from feature_engine) (1.4.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scikit-learn>=1.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from feature_engine) (1.0.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pandas>=1.0.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from feature_engine) (1.3.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.18.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from feature_engine) (1.21.6)\n","Requirement already satisfied: statsmodels>=0.11.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from feature_engine) (0.13.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.7.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from pandas>=1.0.3->feature_engine) (2.8.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pytz>=2017.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from pandas>=1.0.3->feature_engine) (2022.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.7.3->pandas>=1.0.3->feature_engine) (1.15.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: joblib>=0.11 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from scikit-learn>=1.0.0->feature_engine) (1.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: threadpoolctl>=2.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from scikit-learn>=1.0.0->feature_engine) (3.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=21.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from statsmodels>=0.11.1->feature_engine) (21.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: patsy>=0.5.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from statsmodels>=0.11.1->feature_engine) (0.5.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyparsing!=3.0.5,>=2.0.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from packaging>=21.3->statsmodels>=0.11.1->feature_engine) (3.0.9)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Prepare the data set"],"metadata":{"id":"LRL8nELZBLO2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# load the data - it is available open source and online\n","\n","data = pd.read_csv('https://www.openml.org/data/get_csv/16826755/phpMYEkMl')\n","\n","# display data\n","data.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":320},"id":"b0GgUAMBBNJW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655671668594,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":864,"user":{"displayName":"ilias dimitrakopoulos","userId":"13270434416198801137"}},"outputId":"0aeb0480-006e-4f3b-ea98-c2b2a9297ded"},"execution_count":54,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   pclass  survived                                             name     sex  \\\n","0       1         1                    Allen, Miss.
